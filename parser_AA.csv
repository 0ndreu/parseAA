Sinai P.,4.0,        8/30/2019    ,"My fiancé and I had a layover in dallas during bad weather and all the flights got canceled and delayed. After attempting to rebook my flight and my fiancé's and spending 12 hours in DFW waiting on a fight and dealing with rude people that work at the airport we decided to give it one last shot and got in like to rebook our flight.We had such a great experience thanks to KIARA from ENboy she was absolutely amazing, patient and helpful. She tried to rebook me and my fiancé together in the same flight and not just tried but actually managed to get us on the same flight. Well I'm an earlier flight which was even better. Only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because we encountered rude agents in the first 3 attempts of us trying to rebook our flight."Ashley R.,1.0,        8/14/2019    ,"ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINES. It took me 27 hours to fly to San Diego from Dallas. I was supposed to fly to Santa Barbara. After being delayed and getting on plane, they then decided flight was canceled and I would have to go to Phoenix and spend the night. They were not helpful in even trying to pay for my hotel in Phoenix. Then, fly to San Diego and was delayed an entire day sitting at the Phoenix Airport til I was a day late to my own sister's bridal party. NOW, I am at DFW WAITING to find out when time my flight from Santa Barbara leaves. It was delayed 2 hours, we boarded and sat on plane for another 2 hours, then we were told that we were deboardinf the aircraft because there were still engineers working on it when we boarded and actually should not have boarded. They just deboarded everyone, had us walk to the other side of the airport to a different gate and are now standing in line hoping we board although we've been told that no one including staff knows when we are leaving. American Airlines is the absolute worst. The fact that this is a common occurrence is insane. Now they are saying we may be flying to Phoenix. I am supposed to already have been in Santa Barbara right now and giving a speech!!! Flight 5962  NEVER TAKE AMERICAN AIRLINES. Even if you think you're saving, you end up paying a way bigger price than other original options both time wise and money wise."Casey J.,1.0,        7/20/2019    ,"American Airlines DFW Cargo DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANIMALS!We moved from Hawaii to Dallas and had to leave our 2 dogs with family until we found a place to live. Once we were ready to fly the dogs over we researched everything. We called AA Cargo several times, we looked online, and my family even drove down the HNL Cargo to talk to the employees. Our understanding was this:1. The dogs get dropped off at cargo. An envelope is taped to the top of the crate with the paperwork, their leashes, and food.2. They stay in an air-conditioned office type area until they are ready to board the plane.3. They board the plane and fly to DFW. (A direct flight)4. They are first off the plane. Someone gives them food, water, and takes them out to relieve themselves.5. They arrive to cargo about 45 minutes after the flight lands. We pick them up and go home.Steps 1-3 were handled according, but steps 4 & 5 were seriously botched. The flight landed at 8:30 AM, we got there at 8:50 AM. The cargo rep told us that the dogs would not arrive for 2 hours. When asked why he said ""they have to break everything down and bring it all at once."" I explained that we were told 45 minutes to which he replied ""well if you told that, then maybe it will be"". Since we were early we waited. Come 930 AM I was upset. I asked where the dogs were and the rep said he didn't know. He told us since there are hundreds of workers he couldnt call anyone to find out where the dogs were (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!). We didn't accept that so he spoke to his supervisor who spoke to someone else who spoke to someone else and the rep said the dogs would be there ""any moment"". Then 5 minutes later we were told THEY WERENT TAKEN OFF THE PLANE YET and a truck was on its way to get them. Finally they arrived at about 10:15 AM.American Airlines cargo does not care about live animals. The package taped to their crates were UNTOUCHED. No one fed them, gave them fresh water, or took them out to relieve themselves. They spent nearly 12 hours crated. I dare these people to endure a high stress environment and be forced to hold their bodily functions for 12 hours!!! One of the dogs had diarrhea stains on the blanket and both blankets were wet from the water splashing around during transport. This is BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE!!!  Also, the weather was heating up (because it's JULY IN TEXAS) and that's why they were supposed to be taken off the plane first. There are strict temperature regulations which they did NOT adhere to! My question to American Airlines is... Why do you strictly enforce all of the requirements and regulations in order to accept my business, but ignore them after you took my money? We had to spend money and time preparing the dogs for this flight, which we all know is stressful enough on an animal. But you treated them like a plastic wrapped package. American Airlines Cargo is heartless and is dangerous for live animals because they dont care."Evan L.,1.0,        5/12/2019    ,"Absolutely sick of American Airlines. Because their staff couldn't board their plane quick enough, 10 other passengers and I got kicked off of our flight and left at the gate. I was number 6 in a line of 7 or 8 to board, and the ticket counter said, ""just take the next 5."" What do you mean, take the next 5?? Everyone paid for a plane ticket, and because American Airlines couldn't do their job correctly, we get stuck in the airport? Then the ticket counter has the nerve to give me a ticket for 6:00am in the morning and said ""see you tomorrow"" with no aim to resolve the conflict. Then, 40+ other American Airlines passengers (from other flights I am assuming got screwed out of their flights) and I had to wait an hour in line at the Customer Service desk in order to find out what American is going to do to make this right. Instead of taking care of my hotel, or even compensating for their error. They give me a discount coupon on my hotel, which only covered $20 of the $70, which is an even bigger kick in the throat since the Customer Service desk said it would cover at least half. I am absolutely done with American Airlines! If I have to pay $100 extra dollars to get any other airline, I wouldn't even hesitate.American Airlines is the absolute worst airline in the country. They have no respect for their customers, or their customer's money. I can guarantee you that everyone I was in line with feels just as dissatisfied."Lori W.,1.0,        9/7/2019    ,"Recently had our yearly vacation to Cayman Islands. We travel with a two-year-old and a three-year-old. We were not allowed to take their milk on board, so once we were seated on the plane we asked the flight attendants for milk. The youngest was crying so we wanted to try to quiet him. We were told they did not have milk. So after waiting a while, we ask again and then we were told milk was only available for first class. One particular flight attendant was extremely rude and unfriendly, and she did not have on a name tag. She was consistently and continuously rude throughout the flight. We never got any milk! I think we have made the decision not to use AA in the future since we had problems with them from Security before boarding, until flight had landed in Cayman. The staff on the flight back was more accommodating."Loren B.,4.0,        9/4/2018    ,"In the past five years, I've flown 12-17 trips on AA per year, with a few exceptions during which I've flown other airlines for scheduling and occasionally price reasons. Those other experiences have sent me back to American Airlines for their superior service, comfortable planes, and solid pricing.On the DFW to SFO trips, American's prices are consistently the best when buying 4-6 weeks prior. And, the few times they weren't, I went with United, whose planes are older and louder. American's terminals are updated in all the airports I've flown into, which cannot be said for all airlines. Other small things that add up are American's granting of the entire can of soda without asking (United flight attendants looked judgingly at me when I asked for it). And the flights I take always have in-flight entertainment systems at each seat. Flight attendants are typically upbeat and friendly, though once in a while someone seems to have had a long day.Ticket and gate agents are champs. I've been on delayed or cancelled flights and watched them take abuse from passenger #59 in a line of 111 and remain professional. The only real negative experience I ever had was the ""lost bag"" process. In my case, the guys behind the desk were worse than inefficient. The length of time they took explaining the obvious to each person bordered on inconsiderate.I have friends who swear by Southwest. And I get it. I think for me I just prefer an assigned seat and a free checked bag with my AA Citi Credit Card. I'm a loyal American flyer.

Both planes were right on time and arrived early. Staff were very nice.Joa S.,1.0,        6/21/2019    ,"You can feel it. When companies start to spiral downward the feel with their people and service becomes visable. Not happy faces, cruddy service; lack of attention to details.  There are all the associated ""issues"" and ""concerns"" that start becoming more frequent.. to the point of it being the norm as to the exeption.This review was written based on a flying experience we had with American Airlines (AA). On a two leg flight from Bahamas to Phoenix we experienced the following: · As we approah DFW airport the pilot came on the speaker and said there was bad weather at the airport and planes were being diverted; would update as we got closer. 20 mins before arrival. Informed we are in a holding pattern.  Wait... yep... diverted to Austin not enough fuel to hold!· Land in Austin and are informed we cannot get off the plane... international flight. So, we proceed to sit on a plane on a 95° tarmac for over 2 hours with no AC or moving air. Sweltering heat. They won't even let us come to the gate. Couple100 passengers sweating, panting, coughing, farting in an airtight aluminim tube for over two gours Ugh. Ugly! Flight attendants came by ONCE with water.· When those whose final destination asked if the could get off they were informed a manager was coming. Over an hour later the weeny manager FINALLY arrived and was a complete insensitive jerk treating passengers like cattle. Fill out forms. Wait. More paperwork.  No apologies. They did get off... eventually.· Finally a flight back to DFW. Get off stinky plane. By then the AA line to customer service was well over 1,000 people long.  We look at a flight board and our flight to PHX said is was delayed until 1:20am but now at Gate D38, not A18. Gather luggage. Trek to D38 via airport skytrain and long walks. We get there. 10 minutes later... gate changed back to A18 and time moved up to 11:00pm. Okay... hurriedly back to Gate A18. Get there and {{{wait for it...}}} then the flight get cancelled 45 minutes before departure.· Looking at the now much longer AA Customer Service line (1,200 people??? - line runs from Gate A12 to New Mexico I think) my GF stands in line and we hear peeps getting resecheduled two days later. GF gets in line (now seving #5... our number #2,567,894) I nap and later trade off eith GF but I see a gate with a flight departing to Tucson (120 miles from PHX). The flight agent (very nice lady), had some total A-hole gone off on her. I step up and said I bet her day had gotten ""interesting. She smiles and thanks me for caring.  I ask if we could get on. She said she'd check. The AA system had basically almost all but shut down. She said she would just put us on a stand by list.. no fee.  Woo hoo!· Go ""stand by.""  End up being #11 & 12. Peeps don't answer when called. WE get last two seats! Quickly get on plane.  THEN {{{wait for it...}}} we sit on the plane at the gate for well over an hour with no AC or air (see above experience in Austin... especially the farting with guy behind us... OMG! ). They FINALLY get a mechanic who turns on AC to cheers. Then, after 15 minutes you could hang meat in this plane. Brrrr! Oh... did I mention why we were waiting???  No pilots!  Finally...  we get two pilots and off we go.· Just to finish the story we ended up landing in Tucson around 3:15am. Get an Uber ride from Tucson to Phoenix ($175).  Drive up to house at 6:15am 11 hours after estimate arrival.Now... if you have read this far the reason why I wrote not is not to bitch about weather related travel delay. Nope. Good to be safe. I understand glitches and issues that arise out of unforeseen circumstances.  Here is the rub:· Why wasn't there a protocol to care for the passengers on the tarmac in Austin. I felt like a prisoner. No AC, no gate, no water. HOT!!· Why did AA bring on extra peeps to help customers get home. Understand AA has no responsibility to get you a room or food due to weather delays.· Why did they load 100's of passengers onto a plane with no AC and NO PILOTS!! ... and make them wait with no AC, water, etc.This is a multi-BILLION dollar company!!! This is NOT their first rodeo at a weather delay. At their biggest company airline hub  (DFW) ANY delay is going to cause the domino-ripple effect. AA's handling of both customers, caring for their welfare, and having a handle on the technology and logistics should be FAR better.  TOTALLY CRAPPY EXPERIENCE. I expected FAR better. Sad they chose the pursuit of money over caring for people who trust them to get them to.their destination, step up and communicate, to be prepared and basically care.You can see it on their faces and the way they treat their customers.  Never again AA unless absolutely necessary."Monica M.,1.0,        6/19/2019    ,"Yep, have mostly been flying Southwest lately. Just American a few times in the last year.I have flown  (I used to travel American all the time). I booked a flight today for tomorrow and about 7 hours after that (and 3.5 hours after I received check in notification), they cancel my flight!! Then try to claim that there is bad weather in Dallas tonight, so they are canceling a flight tomorrow afternoon.1. No bad weather tonight but a Watch for possible bad weather. Still nothing so far. This was the claim by American for the reason the flight was canceled. Possible bad weather tonight. 3. Did they cancel all of their flights going out or flying in because of possible bad weather? NO! 2. What does that have to do with a flight leaving tomorrow AFTERNOON?!So don't lie to your customers! If the flight was canceled because it was undersold, then tell the truth!

Look, I know I'm in the vast majority, here, complaining about hidden costs, but guys, you've permanently lost a customer. American Airlines is Exhibit A when it comes to contemporary air travel experiences: dirt cheap tickets upon first glance, but mid-to-high-cost after you incur additional charges. Years ago, travelers were rather shocked when airlines started charging fees for baggage; now, American is charging extra literally for everything: aisle/window seats, leg room, and permission to use the overhead bins. I realized this 24 hours prior to my last roundtrip flight, when I was asked to choose my seat, online. Everything's an upcharge -- everything. That $350 ticket, with the baggage and seating fees, easily breaks $450, putting the company in line with companies offering far more comfortable seating, free wifi and often, better flight options. Man, I keep harping on that legroom issue...Because the woman sitting next to me, from St. Louis to Dallas, asked me several times whether she was imagining this. ""I don't think I've ever been this sandwiched on an airplane before. Have you? Look at my knees -- look at your knees -- we're shoving the seat in front of us.

So they are the easiest carrier to utilize from this area.Michelle P.,2.0,        1/5/2018    ,"How many different cities can I have a review in expressing my disdain for American Airlines? Well, now we can add Dallas-Fort Worth to the list. I feel like American Airline is a big bully, and they know it. They have a decent chunk of market share in major hubs, with a frequent flight schedule. Aside from the bargain airlines, their fares are competitive as well. On this trip, I swore I'd never fly with them again, but that would be a lie based on the conveniences listed above. This trip's vulnerability spot surrounded our carry-on bags. I felt all they wanted to do was take my bag away from me, and didn't care about the inconveniences it caused. I mean, why would they care about one customer in coach's happiness? They know people will continue to fly with them, despite any negative experiences based on their heavy presence. In reality, there was a generous amount of space in the overhead cabins AND my carry-on fit. Couldn't they have just let me bring my bag on without a fight? Everything else was standard with flying on any airline. This might have been me being cranky, but the flight attendants seemed extra fake and not too concerned about customer service. I will begrudgingly fly on American Airlines again, but nothing will stop me with leaving another review from another city."Michael M.,3.0,        4/4/2018    ,"Nice boarding procedure, airlines are allowing to many carry On s, it's getting ridiculous.Feel sorry for the flight attendants."Stacy F.,3.0,        12/7/2017    ,"A-Ok seating and gate area for an airline. They have a decent number of plugs and outlets for charging phones / tablets / laptops, etc. It was decently clean, with a couple areas that could have used a bit of attention, but not a big deal. I would say that there could have been more seating overall, since it was overcrowded when the boarding time approached, and many people were left standing. This is fine for most, but if you have anyone needing seating, it may be bad.They are easy to find in the airport overall with signage in various areas. The gate numbers are large and clearly visable.Overall: BA couple areas of improvement would up this another star, but pretty standard overall."Jon H.,1.0,        4/13/2019    ,"If I could do less then one star I would. Worst airline of all time. I would rather fly southwest. Delayed all day until 10 pm then it got canceled, because they couldn't find another flight attendant. If you like sitting in 8 hour lines to get a new flight because of incompetence, and poor planning this is the airline for you. Make sure to book American Airlines so you can be reminded that driving is more cost efficient and with this airline quicker then flying."Dani S.,1.0,        11/29/2017    ,"This airline just keeps impressing me with how crappy they are!! Terrible passenger treatment and extremely strict policies.So I fly all the major airlines in America pretty regularly and have to say AA is just as bad as United if not worse! I was flying back home from a trip and during my return flight my coworkers contacted me about an emergency situation at work that required me to get home slightly sooner. So I asked about standby on the 2nd leg of the flight on an earlier flight. AA refuse to let me go standby, they would however sell me a $400 one way ticket for a normally $100 flight. They also refuse to do same day confirm. I've flown with many other carriers and have done both standby and same day confirm and all very recently. Did that with Alaska just last week. To add, the seats on the plane I took did not recline because it was broken, entertainment system did not work after rebooting multiple times. We were told that there's nothing they can do! AA is simply out to make more and more and more money, forget about customer service or passenger rights or basic comfort. They just try to squeeze every penny of profit."Bill Y.,1.0,        5/31/2018    ,"This review is based upon the performance, or rather non-performance, of AA's corporate customer service office, not their in-flight or check-in service.I paid a rather substantial sum to fly first class across the country on AA.  During my return flight, a brown liquid started dripping down on me from the luggage space above.  I notified the flight crew, who opened the compartment and found it awash in the liquid.  My backpack, which had been pushed to the back of the compartment, was soaked, as were all my belongings inside.  The flight attendants were quick to apologize and clean things up. Unfortunately, the flight had already departed the gate so they couldn't do much more than that.  I had no way to clean up my stuff, so I had to sit and wait for the end of the flight.  When we arrived in Dallas, the flight attendants told me to see the AA clerk at the gate to see how I could seek compensation.  I did so, and was told that I needed to email AA customer service and tell them the details of my flight, and that they (the attendants) could verify my story.  My pack was literally dripping, and keep in mind that although the crew guessed it was soda, nobody knew, so I had a pack and belongings soaked with unidentified brown liquid.  As I had no way to clean or dry it, and had no idea what was on it, I threw it in the trash, along with my clothes inside, and put my stuff in a plastic bag I begged from a restaurant in the terminal. I then wrote my email to AA Customer Service, as directed, while waiting for my connecting flight.  AA responded 8 days later, telling me to send them the bill for the professional cleaning of my items.  I told them that 1) nobody told me to hold onto my soaked belongings and have them cleaned (even if I had been told that, who wants to carry a brown-liquid-soaked bag on their back?), and that 2) I'd like cash compensation to buy a new bag of similar quality.  The AA response was that it ""wasn't their fault"" that the luggage compartment was full of liquid, it was the fault of a customer. I found this incredible.  I mean, does AA have no responsibility to check their aircraft for cleanliness and hygiene?  If a prior customer had thrown up in their seat and I sat in it on the next flight, would that also not b their fault?  I was offered a $100 voucher to use on another flight within a year.  Now, if you know anything about these vouchers, you know that the airlines love using them for compensation because very few are ever used in time.  Even if a customer can afford to fly often, why would they want to go back to an airline that failed them in terms of service?  When you consider that a first-class ticket is about 3 times the cost of an economy ticket, you'd think AA would spend 50 bucks to hold onto a customer.  I never thought I'd see the day that I'd consider going back to United, but I am now."Brandi P.,1.0,        11/15/2017    ,"It is 11/15/17 and I am on flight 315 from Dallas to San Antonio. These are the rudest people working this flight...every single 1 of them has been so belligerent and disrespectful to passengers. One attendant was yelling for everyone to sit down but people were still boarding. The gentleman standing in front of her (as she is yelling in his ear) explained he could not move because of people trying to take their seats. She said ""I KNOW THAT, DONT YOU THINK I KNOW THAT!!!""We were still waiting for everyone to take their seat and another attendant walked up to a passenger on their phone and said really loud into his face, ""BYE BYE, GET OFF YOUR PHONE!""  There had not even been an announcement to not use phones.

We were excited about a well deserved vacation with my family.  While we were able to use our points, it was only available at the worst flight times for the points. Well, the day comes and we board the aircraft, guess what? Delay, then another delay, then another delay that would make us miss the connection to Key West. The final delay pushes us to leaving tomorrow and cutting the vacation a day. Also, they offered a separate line for their business class travelers, but not their status level passengers. I have been on the fence as far as getting another carrier for business and this is now the last trip that I will take on this horrible airline. If I have to drive to Houston just to fly United or Southwest, so be it. Customer service terrible. I am done.Part Two: After completely loosing a day on our vacation, we arrive back for our flight and guess what, more maintenance issues and another delay. We have now missed the third flight from Miami to Key West and if we are lucky, we may get the 5:40 flight. This is completely unacceptable. I would advise anyone to stay away from American Airlines.

Sad ass day!David M.,1.0,        3/11/2018    ,I'm been a frequent flyer flying more than 200 flights a year for over 30 years.  I'm Sapphire status on American Airlines.  I'm not at all satisfied with this airline.  Flight attendants are normally rude and today was no acception.  Flights seem to be delayed or canceled often.  In the passed I've missed days on my vacations and business meetings because of their incompetence.  I only fly this airline when an employer purchases the tickets.  Given a choice I would prefer a more professional and customer oriented airline like South West or Delta or almost any other airline.  The only airline I like less than American but is still comparable is Spirit Airlines.  We recently missed a day of our vacation after a flight was canceled so to engin trouble.  American Airlines knew they had a problem before we even left for the airport and delayed the flight.  Instead of canceling the flight then they had us come to the airport and strung us along all day until we missed all our connecting flights.  The gate agents knew we would be stranded in Phoenix enroute to our vacatiom but never informed us of this until we had already boarded the plane and it had taken off.  A couple of weeks ago while flying through Dallas Fortworth International Airport I had some one steal a LED monitor (valued at $275) while it was going through the belt in security at the American Airlines terminal security check point.  Today I'm flying and we land at the specified time but we have to sit on the plane for more than 10 minutes waiting for ground crew to guide us in and then they made us wait on the plane for another 10 minutes before because they didn't have a gate agent in place.  One of the flight attendants looked like she was ready to go out on the town. She was wearing blue jeans and a black leather jacket.  Holy get your shit together American Airlines or change your name.  You don't deserve to bare the name of our great country when everything you do is mediocre at best.  I can go on for hours about how many customer service wrongs I've witnessed  in my dealings with American Airlines.  I highly recommend you use another airline if you have a choice.  I just finished writing this while sitting on yet another delayed American Airlines flight from Dallas to Las Vegas.And they just keep getting worst. They passed by our row with snacks and didn't even ask if we wanted anything.  Wow!  Your customer service sucks!  Please go out of business so I never have to be miss treated by you again.Manuel S.,1.0,        4/11/2019    ,Horrible service!!@#@!  Changed our gate/time of departure 5 times!!!@#%#@!!  Staff is absolutely no help.

I have been flying with them for years, since their main hub is DFW and I am constantly flying in and out of there.The flight experience really varies depending on if you get a newer plane or not. If you get one of the newer planes, it is much more comfortable and they have TVs to watch. The older ones are a little less comfortable and obviously have less technology. Their in-air wifi never works, although to be fair, I haven't had much luck with that in any of the airlines.I also am almost always forced to check my bag, which I can't stand.

Also, I am covered in layers of surgical garments.  I walked as fast as I could to the gate where I saw my husband pleading with the attendant hysterically.  The plane was still there, but she gave away our seats to standby.  My husband pleaded with her that I was very sick, we have an 8 year old child, and needed to get home.  I asked what happened, she said"" we have a 10 minute policy and there is nothing we can do about it."" I explained to her that I just had surgery and I had to clean myself.  She refused to even look me in the face while continuing to explain that there is nothing they can do about the policy.  Then continued to tell us to go to customer service, so they can put us on standby on the next flight, but there is no guarantees.  I have never been treated so poorly in my entire life.  So callous, zero empathy, and wouldn't even offer assistance to help.  I understand that there are policies and procedures, but how can you legally do this to a paying customer?  Refusing to wait 5 minutes so that someone could clean blood off of their self, is just plain cruel.  The whole time we are trying to tell them our story, we're watching out plane sit there, and they refused to listen to us.  They eventually called a supervisor, but only because I started crying and insisted that they call a manager.  It didn't matter, the flight left without us."Jeff S.,2.0,        8/7/2018    ,Always Have Delayed Flights!

This one rates them as zero stars. Price: Generally they are in the middle of dates if you book a week or two out so this one rates them about 3.5/5 stars because they do price gouge sometimesQuality of boarding/flight:I generally get to board first with my mil ID, and there is the rare occasion that the gate agent decides to do something weird. Have to be in uniform. No, untrue. Have to have orders. No, untrue. Etc. but usually it is just agent with a bug up their butt about military. So that part is zero stars. Once in the plane it is better, but the round stewardess' is getting to be too much. I don't want a 58 year old flabby butt bumping me every time they need to pick up garbage. Come on. Ease of use:In the Dallas A terminal you are almost guaranteed to not arrive back in A. Which makes NO sense.

Never again Fly Delta from DTW much better service and accommodations.Jasmine A.,1.0,        6/11/2016            Updated review,"Continued...On our second flight, my mother, who is under 5 feet tall and is a senior citizen with arthritis, asked a flight attendant if he could help her put her bag in the overhead compartment.  He had moved a couple of rows past our seats, and instead of saying that he would help her in a moment or help her after he had finished helping other people, he said, very rudely, that he had already walked past her row, so she had to deal with her bag herself.  He was so bloody rude, and the passengers sitting behind my mom, who helped her with her bag, overheard him and thought so too.Also, when we told people about how rude the American Airlines staff were, everyone had a story of their own.  Our friend, who is Asian, told us a story about how she cut her foot quite badly on a jagged piece of metal or something sticking out of the airplane floor as she was boarding the plane.  There was quite a lot of blood, and she asked for some first aid supplies, and the flight attendant brought her one small antiseptic wipe and one small bandaid.  She asked for more wipes and bandaids, and the flight attendant dismissed her request and told her to get more bandaids after the flight, which was five hours.  However, when a white passenger asked for some minor first aid supplies, the flight attendant made damn sure she got enough bandaids.  So three stories about rude staff, and no one I have spoken to has a good word to say about American Airlines."Natalie B.,1.0,        8/17/2016    ,Most unhelpful and rude agents. American get your act together with helping your customers not just your elite members. Worst customer service. So unhappy that I had to use American to fly. In the last 4 times I have flown them they have been Terrible. I only fly them if I need to because united or southwest flights don't work. Stop using this horrible horrible horrible companySirron B.,4.0,        9/29/2017    ,Some of the nicest customer service people you will meet in the business.

Flight from AUS to DFW was delayed over an hour, missed my connection to MSP. When trying to booked on the next flight from DFW to MSP, I was in line at the counter and the agent took the pretty lady behind me before me and then when I got up there said he's leaving for the day and to wait for the next agent. No dinner voucher or anything to make the extra 4 hours on my travel more tolerable. From MSP to DFW/AUS: TSA pre-check was not printed on my boarding pass, I had to speak with a manager because the other agent couldn't get my KTN to work and told me I didn't have pre-check. The manager fixed the issue but not before making me jump through some hoops. I logged into customs website and showed my TSA & global traveler Approvals and precious tickets that showed my TSA precheck. Thankfully I was there early enough to deal with that before my flight. There was an earlier flight out of MN to Austin that they would not let me switch to, but would not give me a reason why even though it was not overbooked. Next time I'll fly United or Delta."Jen G.,3.0,        2/25/2016    ,"2/5/16: OMG are we there yet???? Flyin' to San Juan, Puerto Rico for our overnight layover. This flight was almost 4 hours and felt like pure hell. Cuz we were really exhausted at this point. Typical, cramped seats. But we did have aisle & aisle seating.Oh and I initially missed pre-boarding because the beyotch at Gate 28 in San Diego didn't note it on the computer. The gate worker here was apologetic and let me on as soon as I realized we missed pre-boarding.The guy behind me was seriously hacking away. I was praying not to get sick! O.o (Murphy's Law: I later learn he's with my company, going on the same trip and yup ended up sitting at my table during the welcome and farewell dinners...happy ending, I didn't get sick on this trip).But seating was super cramped.

We realized later that the email itinerary shows the wrong date for our return flight. We double checked dates before we hit submit, so it has to be a glitch. We call, thinking that all would be fine. No, American Airlines would not change a thing without $1200! Their system has a glitch, but they give the passengers no recourse unless you find the problem in the fine print within 24hrs. Customer service was rude and incredibly condescending. They never even tried to pretend that they cared or thought that we weren't just idiots who booked things wrong. We usually choose Southwest and we wish we hadn't changed."Michael W.,1.0,        6/15/2017    ,"Flight was delayed 3 times by more than an hour each time. The 4th delay was 6 hours.

It's quicker to take a greyhound bus."Erika R.,1.0,        2/28/2019    ,"This is a company that appears to go out of their way to make you completely miserable. They cancel flights and delay flights, leaving you stranded at the airport without a clue as to when you might depart. Also, even sitting on a flight, being told by the captain that departure will happen soon-- a text alert notifies you that the plane will experience a 40 minute departure delay due to a bathroom issue that they couldn't fix with the 1.25 hour long weather delay. After doing everything they can to ensure you miss any available connection, they give you a 'coupon' for a discounted hotel, which unsurprisingly can not be utilized because there are no available local rooms honoring that rate due to the influx of stranded passengers. And their customer service admits they are a terrible airline, hiding their near hour long service delay behind a weather delay so they don't have to offer any compensation--even though had I only had a weather delay, I would have made my connecting flight. They could also care less I'm fighting bronchitis as I endure my never ending race-- customers matter little to them. I highly recommend this airline if you would like to truly question you whether you will actually ever make it to your destination."Jeanna B.,1.0,        10/8/2018    ,Delay delay delay!

I haven't had any lost bags, delays or other problems that plague airplane passengers. Maybe I've just been lucky but I've flown with American at least 5 times across the US with layovers and not had any problems. On 6 hour flights they have all the new release movies, and on shorter flights they still played a current movie for us. After joining as a frequent flyer they flew me across the US and to my final destination in first class. I don't think that is a guarantee when joining the AA club, but I welcomed the extra perk. I would recommend flying American, especially through Texas, Miami and DC."David C.,1.0,        7/8/2018    ,The crew is very rude and stressed out . I have never experienced something this bad .

Wouldn't fly American againMary D.,1.0,        1/3/2017    ,"Unbelievably snotty ticket agent at American Airlines terminal A on January 2 at approximately 3 PM. Her first name is Lisa. She refused to allow my daughter and son-in-law to bring their stroller for one of their 2 toddlers into the terminal since it weighed 24lbs, 3 lbs over the limit. She kept repeating the American website specifies a stroller cannot weigh over 21 pounds.Cannot believe such  poor customer service... the flight was not full. We were allowed to bring the stroller with us on our first flight. So here's the way this breaks down, I travel on American from Sacramento, Ca. to Shreveport, La. approximately three times a year purchasing multiple tickets each time. I've spent approximately $6000 with American for the past 6 year... so let's take that number and multiply it for the next six years for a total of $36,000 in future revenue that American Airlines will not make from me. So that comes out to 12K dollars per 1lb of stroller. The irony is the flight we were scheduled to take was cancelled, we had to wait an extra 2 hours then move to opposite end of Terminal A ..with no stroller.So my message to American Airlines  ticket agent - Lisa at Terminal A ... you cost your company $36,000 yesterday afternoon. American Airlines you might want to hire kind people who can make customer friendly decisions.

I am a frequent flyer, but this is only my second time flying with this airline carrier. It is so unfortunate how bad their service is. Out of my two flights with them I have experienced riding in a filthy plane, full of rude flight attendants as well as racist gate staff. I understand that at airports there are certain rules and protocol and that we are sometimes subject to random security checks, but I felt very racial profiled during boarding. Out of all the people boarding the flight one of the gate staff members told me that he needed to see my passport. No one else needed to show him their passport just me. He pulled me aside to inspect me while everyone else walked briskly onto the ramp.He looked at me up and down, rudely, demanding my passport. I don't know if he was just having a bad day, but I didn't appreciate the spit in my face as he barked. I would not recommend this airline to anyone! I would rather be sucked out of a plane on a southwest flight than to ride American. Which should speak high volumes."Chris D.,1.0,        11/8/2017    ,No customer service!

I was on a flight from DFW to Pensacola on April 6. After almost 10 hours of delays and cancellations with various excuses from (maintenance, weather, worker's strike, etc) our flight was ultimately delayed/cancelled six times. Instead of just politely telling the customers, please re-book, we were promised that we would make it to our destination. Instead, at close to 12:30 AM- 1AM, the staff finally cancelled the flight. Instead of being polite and apologetic, we were YELLED at by two ""seasoned"" staff members. One staff member yelled at at a young girl who asked nicely for her money back and the professional employee rudely screamed ""I am doing you a favor. You should be thanking me for re-booking you for a later flight you ungrateful girl."" So unprofessional. When I asked for a refund, Sue responded with ""Well you should have paid more for a refundable ticket. That is your problem and not mine.""

I had gone off to the restroom for one last time before boarding and did not hear them! 20 mins till boarding time I realized the people were waiting with me were gone so I checked. I WAS ANGRY!!!! to get from D to A I had to take the train and I almost missed the flight. I hate these unorganized people. Their flight attendants are never friendly and are the bitchiest flight attendants on any airlines. They randomly pick on you for your carry on so they make you check your bag in even though your carry on meets the measurement requirement. I have the same carry on every time I fly.

I was flying from Lubbock to Tyler, with a stopover in DFW Airport. Everything went smoothly on my part, I checked in on time, had my boarding passes in hand, a nice 2-3 hour layover with time for lunch. But when I landed in DFW, I looked to see which gate to go to for my 4:30 flight, and I saw that my flight to Tyler had not just been ""delayed"", but it had been ""CANCELLED""! The next flight to Tyler didn't leave until nearly 9pm that evening, and it was already full (and possibly also cancelled, since the Tyler Airport looked pretty shut-down and iced-over once I got there). I was gonna be automatically bumped to the next flight, which was noon on Monday. Instead, I decided to just rent a car in DFW to drive to Tyler. But I was unable to pickup my checked luggage until at least Monday. I got all kinds of mixed messages between the baggage claim people, the people on the phone, and the people at the customer service desk. They really need to get on the same page somewhere, since the ones at the desk said that the people on the phone don't know anything about the actual airport. Not good team dynamics there. The people were willing to help, but I felt like I needed a ""second opinion"", until I could hear at least 2 of their sources agreeing on something.During hour-long flights, they have complementary beverages & bags of pretzels, usually water, juice, & maybe sodas. Anything else (alcoholic drinks, as well as other snacks) is cash-only pay (how primitive for the 21st century!).Maybe in the future Tyler will have more airline choices, or I'll get the hang of just flying out of DFW, since I've had better flying experiences with United or Southwest."John T.,1.0,        10/7/2017    ,"Worst airline in the world.  Crew could care less about getting us home on time.  Zero initiative after an aborted flight and lengthy reschedule.

The highlight of this Admirals Club  is the ""car wash"" showers with 8 heads - one handheld, one rainfall from above, and six from the sides!  There are 6 of these individual shower / bathrooms with towels and dermalogica body soap, shampoo, & conditioner.All Admirals Clubs in DFW have unlimited soft drinks, beer, wine, & spirits but since I was arriving after an 8 hour flight from HNL, I only wanted orange juice & water.  Snacks at breakfast included 3 kinds of mini-muffins and red & green apples.  There are also menu items available for a fee.If you have the chance, I highly recommend you visit this lounge!  See my many pictures!"Michelle R.,5.0,        7/6/2018    ,"It's a F***** big airport and everyone using it thinks they are above everyone without having to earn it or pay for it.  I think the people who work there that have to deal with people like you.  Yeah lines are long.  If you didn't Bitc* and would just have your da** ticket ready along with your things to be searched and and JUST SUCKED IT UP! they're doing their job.  Got a problem with it?

My family has been flying with them for years. They're number one in customer service number and  number one in overall experience. This specific trip was for my nieces birthday. My mother had payed for 5 flights so we could all go to California and enjoy a good family vacation. One employee ruined this whole experience for me. Her name, Jo, tall, skinny woman, with bangs. I watched her as I came to the front greeting all the first class pleasantly. She seemed to be in charge of the other front desk women. Generally she greeted the first through sixth group with kindness. Once it came to the last groups her attitude completely changed. I heard a voice coming from the intercom saying, "" All the last groups must have a small enough bag to fit under the seat. Bags must be checked in and we will charge you."" Worried I went through the check line and they pulled me to the side. ""Please move to the side so the others can come through that will be 60$"" they said. Never ever in 10 years has this happened to me with American Airlines so I was in shock. To check in a bag was only $ 25. All I had was cash. Jo said, ""We don't take cash.You don't have a credit card?"" A person in line asked what was going on and she explained to him that the people with cheap tickets don't get to have a carry on. I was so embarrassed. She then rolled her eyes, the other lady's she was directing at the front asked, ""What do we do?""  ""Send her back through check in they can deal with her there."" Joe said. She made me look like a criminal. My dad came back out of the plane to see what the hold up was and paid for my bag. Jo made me feel like a peasant. She belittled me and embarrassed me in front of everyone explaining to them it was because of my cheap ticket. All come to find out there was plenty of room in the plane for my small bag. Of course I'll still fly American Airlines. I just write this in hopes they can talk to this woman about how she treats people. I was the last person on the plane as you can see there was plenty of room for a bag."Kate M.,1.0,        9/29/2017    ,"Thanks for the flight delay, missed connection, and the dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed in.. you really know how to treat a customer American Airlines!"Ac H.,5.0,        11/27/2016    ,"We flew on one of the 737-800s that had the interactive screen on the back of the seat in front of us. That was a big hit with the kids. Hopefully American will continue to upgrade planes with those. On a later leg home we flew on an A321. Talk about a junk plane. No in-flight movie. No music channels. No power outlets. The staff (gate, flight crew) were more than friendly to our party of 7 (including 7 kids). They got us to our connecting flights on time, assisted us with bag checks, and check ins.  We made it home safe, with all of our luggage.  Personally, I'd rather fly American than any others."Jill W.,1.0,        9/18/2017    ,"Buyer beware! If you buy a economy ticket make sure you tell the ticket agents how to do their job. I bought the ticket for a one way flight. First let me say I fly AA at least once every six weeks. I have frequent flyer miles and group 5 boarding. This ticket wouldn't let me choose a seat and told me I had to do it at check in. I then get an email that said since I bought an economy ticket I had to do the following1: check in at counter2: pay $25.00 for my carry on bag (one personal ok)3: get boarding pass at counter4: last to board the plane. So a day before the flight. I check in online and there is my boarding pass with a seat assigned and Group 5 boarding.  Hmmm...So I go to the counter at AA and checked in at the counter with a nice lady and I told her I had conflicting information.  She looked up my flight and told me ""you have a seat, you don't need to check your bag you are good to go.""I go to the gate. I again showed them my ticket and to see if there was a different seat. They smiled and told me no it was a full flight. Ok, sit back down and then 10 minutes later I am called back to the gate counter and told me since I have Economy ticket I have to check my bag. I told her all the above and she just smiled and told me ""sorry you got explicit instructions about this purchase. I told her I know and I tried to abide by it but was cleared. She then told me instead on paying $25.00 I have to pay $50.00!!!"Norlynn P.,1.0,        7/8/2018    ,"We were looking to check in and we looked on the monitors for which counter we could in at we went to 35, but it was closed. We had to walk to 16. It was horrible. When we got to our gate they started boarding and they had called military personnel up to board first. Us being a military family we had to get through the standing crowd. And my husband wanted to reconfirm that she had called military And she rudely said, yeah I already called for military personnel"" she sounded so annoyed. And then when we got on the plane I was sitting in an aisle seat holding my son who was asleep. The two flight attendants who were pulling the beverage cart bumped into my arm and didn't apologize. If my son's head was out more they could have hit his head. It was a late night flight, not sorry for trying to have my son in a comfortable position and having my arm in a comfortable position. Never wanna ride American again."Taylor O.,1.0,        1/15/2016    ,"I really despise this company. I have been on eight American Airline flights over the last two weeks. The results of which could comprise a short novel, but in the interest of brevity I will try to highlight only major points. You can assume that many small, terrible things occurred in addition to the shit show outlined below.FLIGHT #1: 45 Minute delay - alleged mechanical issue. No specifics given. FLIGHT #2: One hour delay - alleged mechanical issue. No specifics give . FLIGHT #3: Three hour delay - alleged mechanical issue. No specifics given. * At this point I'm starting to notice a trend. It's also important to note that the weather on all travel days was very good. FLIGHT #4: Missed this flight because, sadly, it was the one flight actually on time and we were three hours late from previous flight (see flight #3)*Upon entering Dallas airport we raced to our connecting flight, but failed to arrive in time. As we made the two mile walk to the American customer service counter (it was 11pm or so), we realized that every plane, from every carrier, in the entire airport had successfully departed. Except for one. An American Airline plane. It too had cancelled after a two hour delay (mechanical issues) and right as we walked by the angry mob of passengers received the news. I had a very important business appointment in the morning. I missed it and had to stay the night in Dallas. Took 1 1/2 hours for our shuttle to arrive and get us to hotel. We hit the sack at 2-3am and woke up at 6am for the new American Flight.FLIGHT #5: Early morning flight. Excited to get home. One hour delay - alleged mechanical issues. No specifics given. FLIGHT #6: 45 minute delay - alleged mechanical issues (I'm not making this shit up, I swear, this actually happened). No specifics given. *flight #6 Gate personnel repeatedly tell us to board the plane quickly when it arrives so we can hopefully make the connecting flight in The next city. We finally board and the staff starts panicking because they can't find a passenger and they literally say ""I think we have a stow away on here!"" * The captain then says ""I'm going to try to make up for lost time by climbing to 35K altitude and flying fast."" And this point I start to reflect and think to myself 'hmmm... This is the sixth American flight in a row with mechanical issues, the staff thinks we have a stow away, and the pilot wants to fly fast to make up for lost time.  I'm not afraid of flying at all, but I'm getting the hell out of here.'So I ask to be let off and get transferred to another flight that was scheduled for flight 1 hour later. Only problem is....FLIGHT #7: 30 minute delay - alleged mechanical issues. No specifics given.FLIGHT #8: 30 minute delay. No reason given. Plane boarded. Upon boarding there is a complete power failure in the cabin. People use their phone lights to find their seats. We sit for another 30 minutes. The captain eventually informs us that a tire is too bald, and has to be replaced. We were asked to grab our stuff and get off the plane due to the mechanical issue (BUT, specifics were given! Not that it really mattered, or was even a step in the right direction, but mainly it was exciting because it was a bit different than the other excuses, or lack thereof). *So this is where we currently stand. Eight flights, and seven delays. The only that was on time was the one that, sadly, we were hoping would be delayed (Flight #4). One of which was an overnight delay and ruined my next day. And since I'm typing this at 11:47pm, in DFW airport while they replace the tire, my guess is ill be sleeping in this city... Again.I have no idea what is going on with this airline. My best guess is that a fleet of old WW2 planes were sold at a sheriffs auction and American Airline picked them up for use in their domestic flights.  But I do know one thing, never again will I allow American Airline to trick me into thinking that, even though the fair is cheap, I will still arrive at my destination on time. Having a safe, functioning, timely fleet of planes clearly is not part of American Airline's business model. Buyer beware."April L.,1.0,        4/13/2017    ,Their customer service is beyond terrible! Where do I start. This was our first time traveling to Paris France and we will never use their airline again. The customer service is terrible. We rushed to catch our connecting flight since they were delayed already leaving Paris and they just close your doors and told us it was too late. We told them we rushed and their flight was delayed and they said they knew right away we were not going to make it. How could they make our family of six with a special needs child and a senior citizen with this rush to the other end of the airport and knowing we would never make it. I asked the gal this and her response was I'm sorry I am not sure why we do it that way.  I have a very sour taste in my mouth and the way they do business I'm surprised they're still in business.Claire Y.,1.0,        1/15/2016    ,"Consistently changing their gates and time. Flight delayed for an hour and I had a meeting at my destination. When asked to switch me to another airline, they said- we are the only one flying to chicago? Are you serious? I took three different airlines when I traveled to Texas and back every time. If American airline doesn't wanna be responsible for your own fault, admit that you're under budget or don't want pay other airline to help your passengers. Simply don't dare lie to your customers because we are not stupid."Paul S.,1.0,        8/28/2017    ,"Why does it take 45 minutes for bags to get delivered at DFW? Only after I complained with several other people did the baggage agent call downstairs and ask about the delay. Of course, once he did the carousel started delivering bags within two minutes! I am an AAL Executive Platinum member who flies 100,000 miles annually. To me and many others, a 45 minute wait for belly bags is totally unacceptable. Get it together AAL!"Be R.,1.0,        1/5/2018    ,"One of the worst Airlines ever since for having lots of maintenance and causing us to have 5 delayed flights in a day and made us Moses our connecting flights... trying to check in for my 7:11 flight to LAX and asking the with attitude customer service of American Airlines named Ana just 15 mins ago instead of being nice for they are the ones that caused me to have delayed flights and missed my connecting flight to LAX for I am asking what gonna happen to my luggage, she said it will check in once you check in with a lazy and not accommodating voice... and I told her how come I cannot check in she is explaining it in a lazy and seems not wanted to talk way that I can't go it have to wait 2 hrs before my flight... it is ok if that's the case but she should be nice for American Airlines put us to a lot of trouble since December going to MS till now going back to LA...calling higher boss of American Airlines your customer service named Ana should be reprimanded , person in baggage questioning .. be nice I did not sleep because you guys delayed my flights from 3:30 To 5:30 To 7:30 To 9: was p then will p:30 then my connecting flight  I missed it.. haay Ana work on your attitude"Scott C.,1.0,        2/22/2016    ,"I recently traveled on American Airlines flight 1067 out of Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX to San Jose, CA this past Sunday afternoon/early evening. I was sat next to a gentlemen who was so incredibly large (mere stature) that he occupied more than 1/3 of my seat. There was absolutely no way of putting the arm rest down, thus forcing me to awkwardly lean into the aisle, where then I was continuously bumped into by flight attendants and customers using the restroom.This is in no way an attack on the gentlemen who was sitting next to me, but I experienced one of the worst flights I've ever been on due to this. Why am I paying full price for a severely sub-standard experience? The flight was full and I was unable to sit anywhere else. I reached out via their online customer complaint department, and I was simply sent back a statement saying that they recognize my complaint, will pass it on, but won't do anything about this.I would like some sort of restitution for a terrible experience. I in no way believe it to be fair that I paid full price for a seat that I was able to use half of.Here is my AA Ref#1-5566704301I am asking that someone from American Airlines take this up a notch and contact me about how we can resolve this.Thank you."James L.,2.0,        1/30/2016    ,If you like flight delays and numerous gate changes then please fly American Airlines.Ayushi A.,2.0,        1/29/2016    ,"American's service has declined so much lately. So I was one of the last few to board the plane and I also had a roller carry on so I wasn't too optimistic that there would be overhead space. When I got on through there were tons of small backpacks and jackets taking up the overhead bins. So when the attendant asked me and this one other man to check in our bags we insisted that he ask passangers to be more accommodating or reshuffle a couple of items to avoid the whole process of checking in. I pack light so that I don't have to wait around in baggage claim for an hour. But the attendant responded with ""I made an announcement that's all I am going to do. I am not going to move peoples stuff around nor am I going to personally ask someone to put their stuff at their feet"". For claiming to be one of the best service airlines I don't that's the definition. This is aggravating because it's not the first time to have happened. When the in flight wifi wasn't working despite having been in the air for about an hour I approached him again and his response was ""do I look like a technology expert?"". I was literally asking a simple question and there was absolutely no need for sass. He was so lucky that Its a small thing and trust me when I recognize that people go through much worse when travelling, myself being one but I think theres something to be said about the staff themselves not remaining professional."Sara M.,1.0,        12/7/2017    ,"Beware when booking flights with connections!! My daughter recently flew from Denver through DFW on her way to College Station. The flight was delayed out of DEN due to de-icing but still arrived into DFW at 0818. My daughter's next flight was due to depart at 0845. Upon her arrival to B33, her Iphone showed a time of 0835. I am still attempting to understand how my daughter and the fellow passengers found themselves at B33 at 0835 with doors closed and no plane at the gate, for a flight with a scheduled departure of 0845 that had a wheels up time of 0853 (18 minutes after my daughter arrived at the gate). The only flight available to rebook all of them on was 12 hours later on a 2045 flight. My daughter sat down at the gate on her computer to secure a rental vehicle. After the fellow passenger and his wife had left the gate, my daughter witnessed four AA employees commenting and laughing about the situation. This inappropriate behavior of these employees is unprofessional in every way. They find it acceptable to laugh and make fun of the customers? Is this what AA is all about? Good customer service revolves around employees being competent, professionally, courteously and respectfully. This has not been what my daughter has experienced today. AA website describes how the organization handles disruptions: ""Our goal is to be a service and product leader in the airline industry. When customer service issues arise, we try to resolve them at the first point of contact. As a result, we have devoted resources to the front line and rely on our personnel to solve most problems during daily activity."" I lost count on how many points of contact I made in an attempt to obtain an explanation and resolution for this situation. Giving the reservations number to the passengers is of no help whatsoever. Reaching out to the dedicated ""Gold Status"" number, no help whatsoever. There is not a customer relations phone number to call; we are left with sending an email?! Are the employees that were laughing at this situation your ""devoted resources?"" I am most certain that AA has policies regarding the treatment of customers with dignity, and respect, and to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. These employees failed miserably. You can be assured that this added insult to injury.After several attempts, I did receive replies from customer service who refused to compensate my daughter for the rental. The Customer Relations department is as far as my ""escalation"" would be permitted. I did write to the Executive VP of People and Communications who didn't bother to respond herself, instead sent it back to customer relations who replied for her. Again, refused to compensate my daughter for her rental."Jeff L.,1.0,        1/15/2016    ,Rudest most unprofessional staff of any airlines I've dealt with... I actually paid someone several hundred dollars to treat me this bad?Allen K.,2.0,        3/1/2018    ,I travel a lot and have to fly with different airlines.  I can honestly say American has been the worst experience to date on both my last two trips.  On my trip I have waited on the plane to pull into the gate for a total of 1.5 hours.  Waited for air crew 35 min twice.  And waited for baggage 45 min or more.    I have one more trip booked with American later this month and I think that may be my last.Cindy N.,1.0,        6/11/2017    ,"If you don't want to spend the whole day at the airport, do not fly with AA!  My flight was delayed for 6 hours and then another 3 hours at the next connection! First, it was a mechanical part on the plane they needed replace before flying. Second, they didn't have enough crew members to accommodate the plane and third, the temperature on the plane wasn't right!! This will all take several hours before you can board. Worst airline I've ever been on!"Veronica B.,1.0,        8/29/2015    ,"AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! Let's start back at the WAY beginning shall we? 10 years ago when hurricane Katrina struck, I was in the Navy and the ship I was stationed on was re routed to be the first responder to help. I had tickets to go home for the following week. I called when I could to tell them about why I would not be able to be on my flight and they told me there was nothing they could do! I said, excuse me?! You do realize I am active duty military being ordered to assist with a natural disaster and you are saying you cannot issue me a voucher for the amount I paid for these tickets so that I can go home at a later time? No the woman said, we cannot do that. Needless to say I was appalled. I saved up for months to buy my ticket in the first place and now I was just out $400.At that time that was basically half my pay per month! So I vowed never to fly American EVER again. And I didn't...until yesterday. HUGE MISTAKE! After 10 years nothing has changed, in fact it's gotten worse! My boyfriend and I departed LAX and hour late due to them having some sort of issue. We were on our way to DFW and were supposed to get on a connecting flight and continue to Norfolk. Due to them being an hour late we missed our connection. I just love how they couldn't hold the plane for 20 minutes so the 6 of us Norfolk passengers could make our connection. Yep that's right, we were only 20 min late and it was BECAUSE OF THEM and they couldn't hold the plane! So I go over to the reservation counter where they tell me that we won't be able to fly out until the next morning. They put us up in a hotel in the middle of nowhere and gave us a meal voucher for $24-how generous! Fast forward to the next day, we are back at the airport, we check in and go to gate C12, the gate printed on our boarding pass. No sign saying Norfolk so I assume maybe after this flight boards they will change the sign-they don't. So I go up and ask about it and the guy tells me the gate is now C24. Ronnie and I walk over there only to find they just stopped boarding! I start crying and screaming that we have 10 min until take off and the plane is right there. To which Kim, an extremely rude and awful employee who is probably just there to collect a paycheck and doesn't give two shits about her job says she can't talk to me while I'm upset. WTF???? Ronnie asked to speak to a supervisor and Brian came over, and was actually sweet and helpful but unfortunately for us and him there just weren't a lot of options. We had to wait at DFW all day since our new flight didn't leave until 6:30. We did get upgraded to first class but Ronnie had to ASK for it-it wasn't offered! Unless they can give me a travel voucher for the $900 we spent on these tickets, I am never flying American again and I will advise my friends, family, fellow helpers, and thousands of social media followers to do the same!!!"Tim S.,1.0,        7/28/2016    ,Negative infinity! Very business unfriendly airline. Had to extend my trip by a day and paid $200 change fee plus the additional $200 difference in ticket price. Then needed to move the departure time to a later flight due to a long running meeting and bam another $75 change fee. Now after a long week Of meetings add an additional 3 hours stuck at DFW because their flight attendant is a no-show. Asked if the could put me on another flight and got the usual run-around with a smug look from their staff. Worst airline ever! Will never fly American again.

My friends and I were on our way to our senior trip in Los Angeles(woooo!). Our flight was scheduled to leave at 7:00 am so we arrived at the airport at 5:45 thinking that was plenty of time. I am TSA Pre-Check so I got through security in 5 minutes but my friends and our moms were stuck in the regular security check line. Three of my friends ended up not coming and the tickets were non-refundable so that gave American Airlines $700 so that they could turn around and sell them to stand-by. I went ahead and got to the gate at 6:40 but my friends and our moms were stuck in the security line for 50 minutes. When they finally got through they ran to the gate thinking that they were 10 minutes early so it was fine. I saw them running up to us and the rude flight attendant began shutting the door. I told her to stop closing it because the flight is not supposed to leave for another 10 minutes and I literally saw my group sprinting only 50 yards away and she said no its too late. It was 6:51. They were one minute late. ONE. I told her to wait because my family and friends were walking up and she said no. Then after shutting the door in my face she goes ""alright let's rock and roll"" with a smile. I understand that they have to prepare a few things before the plane leaves, but they were one minute late, it was 6:51. After giving them three seats for them to sell and make even more money on. She was smiling as me and my friends began to cry. She enjoyed watching us stress out and bicker with each other. I am currently sitting in the airport going from terminal to terminal on standby trying to get 5 people to LA in order to make our cruise. I normally do not fly American Airlines, but the flight was so cheap I could not help myself. It is worth paying hundreds more if it means pleasant customer service.

Well...I'm not a scientist, but I am pretty sure they know when other planes are arriving. So it might be a good idea to get the mechanics in snap snap gear to tow broken down planes in order that paying customers can de-board. Arrived half hour early....nice....and then hafta spend it sitting on the plane. We pay entirely too much for this and TIME is priceless. While I realize a plane doesn't tow as easily as a car....they need to do better than ""well....it will be gone soon is all we can tell you."" Besides that....not a bad flight .

We were stranded in Dallas because our flight coming in was so late that our connecting flight left before our plane arrived at DFW. The agents at the gate DID NOT GIVE A CRAP about any of the stranded passengers. It was 10:30 pm, so there were no later flights going out. They said, ""We only have 10 hotel vouchers a day, and we gave them all away hours ago."" I asked if they could at least offer stranded passengers advice on finding a nearby hotel and shuttle service, so they sent us downstairs to baggage claim. There, another AA employee who had no compassion nor personality gave us a xeroxed sheet of a phone number to get discount hotel rooms. The number had a recording, ""All our discounted rooms are gone"". That left me to fend for myself and find a Red Roof Inn, which I booked through Hotels.com via my phone. At least Hotels.com has GOOD customer service. American Airlines gets a big thumbs down for nonexistent customer service. I will never fly with them again, if there's any alternative."Cynthia L.,3.0,        1/8/2013    ,"After a long flight from overseas, all I wanted was some peace and quiet. Admirals Club was a great place to unwind during a layover. There is an Admirals Club in every terminal at DFW and this particular one was located in Terminal A near gate A23.Pros:- Quick check-in- Free Wi-Fi access- Friendly bartender and staff- 7 individual bathrooms with a shower, towels and soap provided- Plenty of seating with smaller rooms for more privacy, a cell phone and TV free room for those seeking less noisy atmospheres, business center, and a children's room.Cons: - Max 2 drink coupons provided at check-in (I thought it was unlimited drinks? Plus, the check-in rep told me I could use one of them to buy a bottled water, but that was false information.)- Mediocre hot food selection on the menu- Nowhere to take a nap lying flat, only chairsDespite the cons, I liked lounging in the Admirals Club.

I'm sure there are other people who have a connecting flight and can't check their luggage so I'll check mine. When I got my luggage from baggage claim it was completely damaged. It was crushed like a soda can and the bottom was ripped off. So I had to take my belongings out of the bag put it into a trash bag and carry it around the DFW airport because they needed to hand the bag their claims department.Haley P.,2.0,        1/7/2017    ,"The flights were delayed at least twice, and we had to wait in Dallas for at least extra 4 hours just to get a chance to board on the first flight to LA, they didn't give us vouchers for food, we ate in the terminal before they offered us free food at the gate. Although we did not have to spend the night at DFW we expected to get there and leave ASAP, we got the exact opposite."Ashley F.,1.0,        6/5/2016    ,"One of the worst airlines I've ever used... Multiple times. Each time I have had a bad experience with over 3 hour delay. I avoid them at all cost if I can  due to the horrible service. I have never had an issue with the flight team, but the airline itself is out of date, always late and offers no good service. Even head phones are $5.00 for purchase on long flights ... Mind you international flight.. And the plane was incredibly old, we all shared a tv and watched a movie together. For smaller flights this would not be so horrible, but for a international flight in comparison to other major airlines and what they offer and for the price, American has a lot of work to do and honestly needs to catch up. Their slogan and motto does not match the actual experience. It is not ""one world"". It's a just an overall bad experience... Repeatedly.  This use to be a decent airlines about 5 years ago. Not so much now."Ava V.,1.0,        7/23/2016    ,"No warning that my carry on suit case had to be checked in. While during my previous use of American Airlines a few days before, the bag was completely fine and I was able to bring it on the plane. A bit inconsistent. Cold customer service, felt as if I was a burden and very rushed."Allene L.,1.0,        12/20/2015    ,"Yesterday December 19th, 2015 my 16yr old daughter was scheduled to depart on American Airlines leaving DFW to Atlanta at 6:20pm to spend Christmas with her dad. We made it to check in, received her boarding pass and checked her luggage. We made it through security rather quickly considering the amount of people there. Made it to gate A15 my daughter stood there waiting for her group to be called while I watched her from across the way (standing at Popeye's) the crowd got smaller and smaller. I go to my daughter and take her ticket to the agent. There was one very older lady and a fairly young lady both agents. There was also 6 passengers including my daughter. The older agent was taking tickets, while the younger one stood to the side. The agent takes my daughter ticket and I tell her she's not standby because now that's exactly what I'm assuming she thinks. She looks in the computer and hands a young lady back her ticket and stops the couple that are about to board. She tells the gentleman he can board but stops his girlfriend/wife(?). The gentleman is telling his lady friend to come on and tells the agent she's with me and the older lady takes them back and closes the door. I ask if they gave my daughter seat away and the younger agents says she doesn't know what's going on she didn't board the passengers, but she's clearly trying to put my daughter on a different plane now as a standby as the older lady told her. I ask her why isn't my daughter able to board and the she says they stop boarding 10min prior to take off ""WE WERE THERE"" and they put that couple on the plane at 6:27pm well after take off. The older agent ignored me as if I wasn't there and ask the younger one who was she talking to. I was beyond pissed but tried to keep my composure. I'm asking if she gave my daughter seat away and telling her boldly that she was lying to all of our faces, she just loaded a couple after boarding. Now I don't know if the other people were on standby but my daughter wasn't. We were there on time. If we were late we would've been reschedule at check in. My daughter said she felt sad because she felt like they were being racist. Even if they weren't the attitudes they had didn't make it seem if they were being anything else. At that point my mind was made up that my daughter wasn't going not even on a later flight.  There was absolutely no way I would trust AA with my child. All I wanted was her luggage which I was told I couldn't get because it was on the plane. I spoke to the the supervisor at check in. When he saw us he ask what happened and if we were held up at security with a confused look on his face. That was not the case. AA had given my daughter's seat away. They didn't call final boarding, they didn't call out the names of the passenger who checked in but had not boarded. They simply gave her seat away and had a attitude because I called them out on that and the lie regarding no boarding 10min prior to departure. American Airlines I suggest you get it together before you stumble upon a customer protest for better quality customer care and service. #americanairlines"Angela S.,1.0,        6/3/2016    ,"Worst airline I have flown with.... I have chosen them once again due to rates, BUT I will NEVER make that mistake again! The extra $20-$30 for a friendly staff, on time flights and less change of planes or gates last min.... I will not be flying this airline again and getting side tracked for trying to save a couple bucks!!!"Anne J.,1.0,        8/30/2017    ,"Arrived at gate to get connecting flight from Dallas to Frankfurt, to be denied onto our flight!!! Literally denied for no reason! We made it on time to the gate, despite our flight from SFO being delayed ( ridiculous reason for that too! A logbook needed to be on board, which delayed us an hour). Rather than assisting us ( and others)with our close connection, they sold the tickets from under us and closed the gate early! We had no check on luggage, and had passport and boarding passes in hand. Flight was to leave at 4:35. They said the gate would close at 4:25. We got there at 4:20, and we're told they were finished boarding early and we couldn't get on. No reason. No help. The airline knew we were going to be cutting it close ( again, their fault for ridiculously unnecessary delay), and rather than help, they profited from it. Insult to injury was the extremely rude customer service staff ( they are just incapable of dealing with the systemic disfunction and angry passengers, but that's no excuse). American Airlines can sell you a ticket, then steal it from you to sell to someone else. They are a disgraceful company! No company should be able to treat clients like that and leave them powerless. Do not give them your business. Doesn't get much lower."L H.,1.0,        8/17/2014    ,"My business and I have decided to seek other airlines after our several tragedies with United. American Airlines was chosen not for price, but schedule. We have not used them in 8 years since they cancelled a flight to a business meeting. I thought I'd give them another chance, flying the weekend of 9-16-14, I feel as though I have been abandoned! We were sent to several other gates and back to the original. Boarded and de boarded. These people are clearly unorganized! My thought is if the government stopped contracts for the military, they may have to change their business procedures.  Terrible customer service!!"Andrew N.,1.0,        5/20/2016    ,"Had to stay overnight after flight was overbooked. We reserved over 2 months in advance. No hotel was given, slept in the FREEZING cold terminal and our bag was on its way so we had nothing for the overnight stay in the terminal. I don't know who is worse, AA or United. They did verbally apologize though...."Brian H.,1.0,        4/5/2017    ,"Worst service ever. Bumped from flight, blamed for it, told to go to AA.com when we asked for a supervisor. Told to call 911 when a diabetic traveler in our group asked about the insulin in the luggage they'd already loaded. Sudha Kumar was disdainful of our requests."Chris B.,1.0,        8/21/2017    ,"I land in Dallas 20 minuets or so late for my flight from Philadelphia that got held up. This plane from Dallas happened to be the last one of the night going to California, and instead of holding the plane, because their incompetence in Philadelphia (look at my Philadelphia American Airlines Review), they send it off without myself and 3 or so other people that got stuck in Philadelphia. I get off the plane and go to speak to the first help desk person I see as I was instructed and one was super mean, and the other one was very dismissive. One of them eventually tells me to stand to the side until he can help me. I wait and wait from 10:30pm-12:30am to finally be helped. And instead of offering to put me up in a room for the night they tell me, ""We can't get you a room for the night, because it was not our fault. There is a note in our system that says Air Traffic Control said we couldn't take off. So we can't comp your room. We can give you a discount, but you are responsible for your mode of transportation as well."" So I had to spend the night in that terrible airport. I slept uncomfortably in a chair, when I could get to sleep. I ended up getting sick. And my doctor says I most likely got sick from sleeping at the airport.

Thru cancelled our flight and then provided no assistance despite the fact that we needed a place to stay for the two extra days we were stuck and then they changed our fought again so we missed it and they never apologized for any inconvenience. It's like they looked for people that enjoyed working as slow as possible and doing so without once apologizing for a wait or attempting to alleviate the situation. Now we are stuck at a gate. In addition they Hanford a major security issue get poorly. In the first flight a man dropped a large black bag at my ferry and walked away quickly down the aisle. No flight attendant was paying attention despite the clear concern of many passengers myself included.  On our second flight we stood in line for 45 minutes which made us miss our flight and in line we noticed a bag left again unattended. We informed the guest and instead of immediately calling security they spent five minutes asking who's bag it was. This company has proven themselves poor in all aspects of customer service and especially in safety.  Our flight attendant seemed like a 18 year old immature girl incapable of handling any situation on board and everything was late. I will not be flying American again.  I would rather fly United and risk personal injury!Jeffrey M.,1.0,        2/10/2016    ,"Usually a Delta flyer but took a deal on flights from SF to Tampa by way of Dallas. No deal at all. Was charged 60$ for bags per flight! So the deal I got on the ticket turned out to be 100$ more after all the baggage charges. 240$ for my luggage to go with me on this trip. Not to mention the flight which actually arrived 15 min early only to keep us on the plane for an hour waiting on a gate! Oh and now the check in kiosk prints out your bag tags too so be prepared to pay, tag your bags and haul em up! Never flying American again"J.

And needed to check the roller bag.     Another passenger offered to carry her computer bag only to be manhandled away onto the jetway.      These AA employees were absolutely clueless about what safe dependable and FRIENDLY air transportation is like.   It was an awful example of employees with authority/power having no clue how to use that power.    The flight left the gate late and passengers certainly understood that these AA employees had Zero interest in making their experience friendly.   I am disgusted. flight 1072, DFW to PHL.

Even if we take comfort out of the equation, should there be an emergency, I would not have been able to get out.  When I emailed my concerns to AA, the response I rec'd was that I should have spoken to the flight attendant about it.  So let me get this straight:  Your gate agents AND flight attendants, who are trained and held accountable for ensuring the safety and reasonable efforts at comfort for passengers, were not willing to address the issue, but I am supposed to, in front of the passenger, ask the flight attendant to move her or me?  Wow!  Once again, American Airlines, you show your complete lack of loyalty to your loyal customers, and your complete lack of regard for reasonable accommodations."Mindy C.,1.0,        5/5/2015    ,"Everyone complains that American Airlines is SO BAD IN CUSTOMER SERVICE and I experienced this for the first time today. I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE MORE RUDE THAN THE AMERICAN AIRLINES SUPERVISOR, MITCH MCDONALD, AT DFW INTERNATIONAL! I was waiting in line with my elderly dad and nephew, who isn't even 2 years old yet. The ticket counter rep, whom I later find out is the supervisor Mitch McDonald. He yells ""come on,"" in an impatient voice. We were just waiting our turn, why the immediate attitude? Then he tells me I cannot escort my elderly dad, who is almost 70 years old, nor my nephew to the gate because my dad isn't disabled and thus can easily get to the gate himself. He said it has been a policy for a ""very long time,"" despite my having had done it less than one year ago. I think fine, I'll let it go. Then rudeness with checking in our bag pursued. Mitch McDonald apparently doesn't like being told that our carry on isn't a car seat. Car seats fly for free so I'm sorry for correcting you and trying to pay for the checked bag. He then only gestures for us to put the bag on the scale and not realizing what he's trying to do, as we stood in silence. He finally uses his words and tells us to put it on the scale. Once complete, HE THROWS MY DAD'S TICKET AT ME! THEN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WALKS AWAY! I WAS LIVID AT THIS POINT. So I walk my dad and nephew to the security line and head back to ask for Mitch McDonald's supervisor ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT AMERICAN AIRLINES CONDONES THIS BEHAVIOR, because evidently he was the supervisor. I asked him if he thought, as the supervisor, that how he acted was an appropriate way to treat a customer. He played dumb and asked why I thought that, while saying that he didn't know he threw the ticket at me. No apology, no sorry for the confusion. Nothing! You can see why he was reluctant to give me his name.

So excited to make it finally happen and chose American Airlines because of there superior service. Well let me how tell you how very wrong I was !!!! We flew from Utah to FWD just to be told seconds before boarding our connected flight to NC that our plane trip was now being delayed for a hour. Well no biggie I thought. Well I was wrong. That one hour made it so we would miss our connecting flight to Rome. Was told to speak with customer relations and they could accommodate us. So we rush to customers relations only to find out that they had no clue what we were talking about and had to call back to the gate to find out what was going on. Keep in mind we were told at the gate that our plain was here and ready in time but 2 of the stewardess were delayed. So you mean to tell me that American Airlines doesn't have stewardess that they could call in or swap shifts so that passengers can keep the scheduled flights that we booked over 6 months ago. So now my dream vacation has been put on hold for 24 hours. I am stuck in Texas with no luggage, no  clothes and all the customer service relations could say is "" well you don't look dirty !!!"" Really !!!! I've lost a day of of my dream vacation. Missed my tour of the Vatican and all they can say is it's not their fault. So my dream vacation and hundreds of dollars has been reduced to 3 days. I will never ever fly with American Airlines again unless they make this right and I will let everyone on social media know.

On our last trip (to and from San Cabo, Mexico), the seats were so old and worn out that it actually hurt to remain seated for too long.  We had to take the blankets given to us and fold them up to sit on as extra cushion for comfort.  To top it off, the in seat video equipment was completely broken so no entertainment the whole flight.  Of course we constructively gave feedback to the flight attendants and who ever would listen during and after each flight.   But the kicker for us was that after the last flight (where the seats were ridiculously uncomfortable due to age and use) we wrote in to corporate customer service reviewing the past 4 flights and requesting to speak with someone.  Within 12 hours we received a form response of ""sorry to hear you had a negative experience, we are upgrading all of our equipment soon, blah blah blah"".  So they took our money gladly for these flights (no discounts or extras due to using old and worn out equipment) and then we are supposed to feel ""better"" about the terrible experience because at some point in the future they will have new equipment and furnishings?  To me this meant that going through standard customer service would result in my concerns being thrown in a waste basket and someone would pat me on the head and say ""awwww, oh well we'll do better in the future!"".  Given that my career involves improving consumer engagement and satisfaction, I wanted to be part of the solution and give American Airlines a chance to demonstrate their best customer service.  I called the 1-800 customer service line and explained to the person that answered the call the problems over the past 4 flights, that we had emailed and received a disinterested, form email in response, and asked to speak to a supervisor or manager.  It took a bit of time but a manager finally picked up the phone.  I explained the reason for the call again, pointed out our frequent flyer status, told her that were NOT looking for refunds or favors, and asked how I could get feedback to someone at the corporate level.  Understanding that they would not give out a phone number, I asked if someone from corporate could contact me by phone or email.  They were not interested in that option, the only option given was for me to write and mail a letter to the next highest level person in the customer service chain.  The customer service manager wasn't rude, but also clearly knew nothing about service recovery as she answered my questions with short replies and simply rattled off a name and address for mailing a letter.  Her approach makes sense right?  Put the burden on the customer and make them jump through as many hoops as possible to get constructive feedback to someone in a position to actually DO something with that feedback.  So I wrote and mailed the letter....and have never heard from them.   I have no idea if they received my letter and ignored it or never even received my letter. Moral of the story:  Some large companies actually DO care about consumer feedback and corporate executives actually get involved at all levels to make sure they understand what is happening on the front lines. The front lines are where you lose customers and have the opportunity to make small, but meaningful changes to service/operations that help retain customers. Apparently American Airlines thinks customer service is form emails and hope that they can make feedback/complaints process so difficult that the consumer gives up.   I went out of my way to provide helpful feedback and try to get it to someone that might actually care about what I was saying and was rewarded with an attitude of indifference. As of January 1, 2017 my husband and I have switched to Delta and booked our flight in April to Cancun with them.  Here's hoping Delta can do better than American!"William H.,1.0,        11/3/2015    ,"In a nutshell, I've been on the standby list since 4 pm...it's now 7pm and I've been bumped 3 flights-- and I'm a member!  Airlines like this are the reason why people fly Southwest.

My mother has flown multiple times with AA DFW and brought the same dog and the same crate with her with no problems. When she asked why this is so, the manager Elise questioned my mom and said, "" are you saying that I am the only one that does my job correctly?"" Crying and in a wheelchair my mother was turned away and had my Sister come in to speak with Elise. B. When Elise was notified that was my sister was there to speak with her she refused to come out. My mother was not allowed a refund and now has to pay double to rebook.

I made it on time for boarding, except they tell me they close the doors 10mins before boarding?! Why not say boarding 1120 since your doors close at 1130 not 1140!! My ticket I did not use, I would have to pay a 200 dollar fee to use. And if the traveling is more than the 400$ I paid... I'd have to pay the extra with the 200! I cannot believe they shut doors ten mins before the boarding time they broadcast! It makes no sense I've never had this problem. No more American Airlines for me or my family members who travel 4+a year! Thank God for Alaska Airline miles."Marina C.,1.0,        8/1/2015    ,"The service is horrible, and the employees don't care about the passengers. They overbook flights and won't guarantee you a spot on any airline until maybe the next day, but even that isn't certain. They also don't update their passengers and just make them wait for hours until they continue to delay the flight, or even cancel it. I've had way better service with several other airlines, and I have to say that American Airlines don't provide the customer service  that they should. You end up wasting your money and time, and for that they say that they are ""sorry for the inconvenience"" even though they really don't care. And what do they do? - they give you a voucher for a hotel. As if I planned to stay in a cheap hotel in a random city that I wasn't planning on staying any longer than I have to. Oh and the customer service is deplorable, just the information booth had no workers so we couldn't even get hotel vouchers. I don't think anyone should ever use this airline again, unless you are okay with taking the risk of not even being on the flight that you booked."Marina G.,1.0,        8/29/2015    ,Crap. Our flight has not taken off yet due to an apu problem. We have been stuck on the flight for 40 minutes with no air. Why can't they let us off the flight while the fix it. We have not seen one steward to get us water or ice. Never will I take Alaska thru American Airlines again. Too top it off I was told I had an aisle seat and I'm stuck sitting here in a middle seat.Judith C.,1.0,        7/17/2015    ,My family have spent the entire day trying to get to Huntsville Alabama from Dfw.

They have been standing in line to reschedule their trip since then over one hundred people in line only two clerks working. Shabby horrible service. My parents are elderly my sister is handicapped and now the possibility is to sleep where. The floor?

We are currently filing a lawsuit. They didn't even apologize, just said that's how things work sometimes. Never fly them!! Other airlines at least apologize and help you with a hotel.

It is an apparent attempt at a new cozy concept to manipulate passengers into complacency.  It sucks! There are plenty of employees standing around and no one said a word to us during our confusion.  You feel like you walked onto a Star Trek set (and I mean the 1967 version). There are no signs that stand out so it is impossible to determine if your flight is still going out of this area. (Last time I checked into AA in DF/W, the counter agent didn't tell me my flight changed terminals when I checked a bag!  That's important at Dallas! ) So apparently the NINE employees in the area can no longer do this: you now have to print your own baggage tag, tag your own bag, go to one counter to get it weighed and another counter to check it in.  Seriously?  The NEW kiosks to check you in do NOT accept the boarding pass on the AA app! Why would they design a system that doesn't use their own App that they promote?!

I just flew my family from San Jose to Kona. I have 5 people in my family and they would not sit us together. They want families to upgrade their seats to sit together. Even though I bought the seats 3 months earlier. I called and they said if you want to sit together we needed to pay 19 dollars more per seat. I have a minor child also. So if you have minor children stay away from this airline. On top of that 3 people got sick on the flight. The reason is they bought new planes and they are lighter so it was a bumpy flight for over 4 hours. They are also slower. The flight was longer than previously with Virgin Airlines. It saves on energy but they do not fly very well at all. I have been on 3 different planes and they were all rough rides on the new planes. Take my word for it. They are not family friendly at all anymore and they do not feel like stable planes.Cha C.,5.0,        5/21/2014    ,Love the cappuccino machine.  Didn't know this one had a mini gym.  Won't mind a longer layover next timeAlicia B.,1.0,        8/25/2015    ,"This was by far the worst security experience I have ever encountered a man by the name of Michael, the one who checks your ID and boarding pass before heading into the screening and scanners for bags and people, was so rude and unprofessional. There were about 6 of us waiting to get through, so not busy what so ever and he was telling people to get back and he will tell you who goes next and when he is ready to do so no one was rushing people were literally trying to stay together with their families and he literally made them separate away from one another and making very rude and inappropriate comments to everyone. He also said you people don't tell me how to do my job I tell you how this place is ran. Obviously he is missing some type of sense of authority it's just not ok to treat anyone like this. And the worst part is that he was treating a very nice older woman so poorly who was so nice to him but clearly confused as to why he was being such a jerk to her.

The flight attendants are generally much nicer and more attentive. Plus, they can actually fit in the aisles. While some of the AA flight attendants on our 4 flights were nice, they all disappeared after the meals were finished, whereas the Asian flight attendants who were on our China Southern and JAL flights were continuously available. In fact one of the AA flight attendants was just nasty. It's beyond me why AA hasn't fired her for her nasty attitude towards the passengers. I can only guess that she's the affirmative action flight attendant. She reminded me of the young girls who work at the inner city McDonald's with their snotty attitudes. In the future, I will return to flying only on Asian airlines."Kevin C.,1.0,        1/19/2016    ,"Incompetent is the only way I can describe the management of American Airlines.  A delay is sometimes expected when flying, but a delay of 10 hours because of improperly scheduled staff is unacceptable. I booked my flight over 2 months ago.  I made my arrangements and prepared for my vacation ahead of time.  Now my entire schedule is thrown completely off because ""the crew is over their allotted work hours"".  I'm all for the crew having their time off.  No one wants a cranky, sleepy crew working.  But it is the management's job to foresee these type of problems, not to make these the problem of the travelers who were careful enough to plan ahead.  I will definitely not be using this airline again for my traveling needs."Karen C.,1.0,        12/22/2015    ,"I travel often and American Airlines continues to disappoint.

None of that happened. I've been late in my time in the workforce. We all have a time or two. But at least act like you've done something wrong. Don't act like its something to be expected.

You won't regret the comfort."Gary H.,5.0,        4/12/2014    ,"We were in the Terminal C Admiral's Club yesterday for a couple of hours (on our way back to San Antonio from Toronto) and I plugged in my new iPad to charge it. When we headed down to catch our next flight, I inadvertently left the iPad behind! Early this morning, when I was unpacking my briefcase and realized the iPad was missing, I called DFW and spoke with a very helpful woman named Joanie. At that point, I admittedly wasn't very optimistic about the likelihood of retrieving my poor little iPad, but Joanie not only found it, she also volunteered to ship it back to me on her way home tonight because she passes right by a FedEx office. I've been an Admiral's Club member for well over 10 years now and their staff at DFW is top-notch. When things are rolling along nicely, without complications, you really can't tell that much about the quality of folks you're dealing with. But when there's a small emergency like this, you find out in a hurry! Thank you, Joanie!"James V.,4.0,        4/17/2011    ,"Okay, so who doesn't like the Admirals Club, huh? Unless you can't get in or you're too cheap to buy a membership. When the terminal is crazy insane with irate passengers and screaming kids, this club is just a little slice of heaven. One club in each terminal, they're all nice but my personal favorite is terminal A."Joe F.,3.0,        7/26/2011    ,Good admirals club food lacks and so does serviceLynedon V.,4.0,        7/10/2011    ,"Excellent location between flights. I've been to all of them in each of the 5 terminals. Super service. Free drinks and Internet stations s well as free wi-fi. Comfortable destiny In multiple settings: regular lounge, quiet rooms, bar, large screen TV room (most with multiple rooms), business centers, children's play rooms, reclining sleep areas, music chairs, power outlets everywhere, customer service desk, continuous supply of snack, much more... Been a member for many years! Great travel retreat location with showers to freshen up on long trips or before leaving the airport before meetings. Well worth the membership fees!!!"
